Some rules for internship/studying at CISLab:
   <ol>
       <li> Don't bring any lab devices/materials out of lab or use them without permission from CISLab's professor/assistant manager</li>
	   <li> Don't discuss lab materials with others without permission from CISLab's professor but you can discuss with our labmates. Please keep confidential on our work.</li>
	   <li> If you want to use GPU servers for deep learning training, please register with Mr. Yi-Ping <a href="mailto: k94077087@gmail.com">  k94077087 (at) gmail.com </a> or Mr. Terry <a href="mailto: th04e22@gmail.com">  th04e22 (at) gmail.com </a>  (our lab hardware manager)</li>
	   <li> Don't talk in loud voice if labmates are working. Please keep polite.</li>
	   <li> You are encouraged to work and presence at our lab any time you can, at least 2 days per week. Lab is open 24/7 but you need to have card to enter lab building in night time.</li>
	   <li> Please keep your seat clean and tidy.</li>
	   <li> If there is any issue, please report to the professor (e.g., report important things only) or your host student who welcomed you or tour you around CCU (e.g., report daily life issues, food tasty or small things). If they cannot solve, you can contact the professor via his email</li>
	   <li> When you travel at the free time (e.g., weekend), please keep safe and polite with surrounding people. You can use Google Translate if local residents cannot speak English </li>
	   <li> Please share several good images (> 5) of your life/travel activity or the places you love here to <a href="mailto:interns.cislab@gmail.com">interns.cislab@gmail.com</a> several days before you depart to return your home country. We may need them for reporting to TEEP program</li>
	   <li> Due to many internship students coming, we will allocate a dedicated meeting time for internship only on <b>every Wednesday, 4:00 PM, Room 105, CSIE </b>. All intern students are required to show up at this weekly meeting.</li>
